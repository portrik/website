Welcome to the repository for the source code of my personal website! This project is intended to be a showcase of my abilities to develop a website project with modern technologies and a complete CI/CD pipeline.

Additionally, the whole project can be exported into a neat A4 sized PDF as my CV.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

While the project is written in the latest iterations of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/), the whole code is bundled by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) into a static website.

The styling is done through [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). However, this could be expanded into [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) if I ever needed advanced theming.

The code quality is guarded by [ESlint](https://eslint.org/) in tandem with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [Rome](https://rome.tools/) and [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/).

The testing is done through [vitest](https://vitest.dev/).

Additionally, the project uses GitHub Workflows for [validation](.github/workflows/validate.yaml), [CodeQL](.github/workflows/codeql.yaml) and [deployment](.github/workflows/deploy.yaml).

### üî® Running Locally

The project requires

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v19 or newer
  * Although older versions may work, they just have not been tested
* [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager

The development version in watch mode with hot reloading can be started with

```bash
pnpm start
```

The preview with all of the optimizations and without hot reloading can be started with

```bash
pnpm preview
```

The linters can be started by running

```bash
pnpm lint
```

And, lastly, tests can be executed with

```bash
pnpm test
```
